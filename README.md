# 👋 Hi, I'm Ian Dominic Sumpay

- A graduate of Bachelor of Science in Comptuer Science
- I knew C, C++ which I have used in competitive programming contest
- I used JavaScript, Java, Python and some of their frameworks to build projects
- I am curious what is under the hood  of the tool I am using, I am curious how data flows in a system, and how component interacts
- I am a person who not just want to use tools, but also want to understand them: the structure; architecture; design; and philosphy
- I have created project using MERN stack (JavaScript), Spring-Boot (Java), and Flask (Python)
